Signature Specimen Matching using ANN
by Louie Pascual, John Dinnex Valeros, Al Arazas, and Allan Sioson

Abstract:
In this work, we used an artificial neural network to do offline specimen signature recognition and achieved 99.47% accuracy given the 940 raw images of signatures of 79 authors from the SigComp 2009 dataset.

Note:
The repository includes the source code used in extracting the features from the images, generating the datasets, and producing the ANN models.
